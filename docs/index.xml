      <description>Notion is a spectacular success story, a textbook rocket ship. Between 2019 and 2020 alone, its number of users grew from one million to over four million. When the pandemic filled the startup world with a freezing terror, Notion raised $50 million in 36 hours. A deluge of fabulous reviews keeps pouring. Passioned tweets, exalted Youtube videos, grassroots meetups. That&amp;rsquo;s the stuff of dreams, for countless entrepreneurs, product managers, and designers from San Francisco to Beijing.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Isma√´l. I write user research software and articles about&amp;hellip; user research. I used to be a software developer, an analytics consultant, and an A/B testing fanatic. I worked at Yahoo! and did consulting for several French enterprise companies like Carrefour and Orange.
I had a lot of dreams when I was young. The dinosaurs have disappeared since. ü¶ñ Nowadays I mostly dream about UXR.
