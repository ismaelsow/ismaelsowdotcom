February 1st, 2020 edit: I had published this article on Medium on May 5th, 2018. The project is now called Searchness and a lot of progress has been made since. ðŸ™‚


There are times when you feel you are not quite ready for prime time but itâ€™s time to launch. You work like crazy on some little project of yours. Hours pass. Days pass. Then weeks. Then months. For some, we may be talking about years of coding in a dark cave!

The problem is you are still not quite there yet. The product is not ready. Well, at least you think so. It doesnâ€™t work everywhere. In addition to the web, iOS, and Android versions, you also need to have a Windows Phone version. After all your biggest coolest hypest competitor has one!

The road is so long, progress is so slow and the landscape is so fucking monotonous!

Do you know that feeling?

I know it. Let me tell you a story. This is the story of Userstand, a UX research app Iâ€™ve been building since August 2017 and that I soft-launched to crickets in February 2018. No tale of epic waves of traffic flooding the site with cash overflowing my bank account. Zero upvotes. Zero comments. Zero public feedback. Zero customers. Zero revenue. Crushing blow.

Do you know that feeling?

I know it too well. Iâ€™ve launched many things in the past and they all failed in their own special, stupid ways. I wrote an ebook, made a few sales but lost money overall. I launched a blogger-oriented iPhone app for comment marketing that I didnâ€™t even market. I worked on a Twitter typing game who made no money and a transcription platform for the french market that was unprofitable. None of them worked.

But now Iâ€™m writing a new story, the story of Userstand. I believe in Userstand more than Iâ€™ve believed in any project in the past. I believe that the story of Userstand will be a success story. I believe in the ultimate success of Userstand with an iron faith.

Why? Why am I so sure that things will be different this time?

The answer is really simple. This is the first product that Iâ€™ve really built for myself, in an existing market that I understand. Userstand is the app that I have always needed to make it stupidly easy for me to talk to my users regularly and synthesize what they tell me in an organized and super fast way. It will serve me for any project that I can come up with in the future. If you are doing user testing and user interviews, it could also serve you well :)

In the coming weeks, months and years, I plan to share my journey as I build Userstand the product and Userstand the business. I hope it would be as helpful to you as I know it will be for me!
