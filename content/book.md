If you're like most UX Researchers, you may sometimes feel like you're selling sand in the Gobi desert. You're selling water but people think it's sand, and they've already way more sand than they need.

**How can you ensure that your research makes an impact?** You have to take your barrel and spill some of the water. Let people see and taste the water for themselves. Show the insights and the raw data to your stakeholders.

**How do you ensure that you find the right insights and data when you need them?** Well, you retrieve them from your research repository. If you have one and if it works. The problem? It's certainly not working as well as you'd like.

## ü§∑ Building Research Repositories Is Hard

Here're some of the problems that teams are facing with their research repositories:

- They're starting from scratch and don't know where to start
- There's an avalanche of tools: they struggle to make a choice
- They've chosen something: the setup is more challenging than expected
- Migrating legacy data into the new system takes a frustrating amount of time
- Putting new data into the repository is a manual process
- There's a tag jungle: it's increasingly difficult to retrieve content quickly
- Over time, duplicates, orphan tags, and other renegades creep up everywhere
- Stakeholders find the system too complicated and never log in
- Etc.

I'm convinced it doesn't have to be that hard. That's why I'm writing a book on research repositories, first to get smarter on the subject, secondly to share my learnings with fellow UXR people.

## üî∞ Antifragile Repos The Easy Way

All of the problems outlined earlier stem from the fact that most of the research repositories we build are fragile. They break when more people use them; when more data get stored; when use cases start piling up.

What's needed are systems that grow stronger and become more valuable when more people use them, the more data they ingest and the more use cases we run them through. **We need antifragile repos**.

In this quest, here're the main topics I plan to cover:

- Designing and Managing Your Taxonomies
- Managing a Research Repository Creation or Migration Project
- Maintaining and Optimizing Your Research Repository
- Building a *Research Collective Brain* for Your Entire Company
- Benchmark of Tools Like EnjoyHQ, Dovetail, Condens Etc.
- Step-by-step Example of a Complete System in Notion

I'll also provide re-usable templates and in-depth interviews with folks that have successfully implemented research repositories at scale.

Whether you're a UX Research Manager, a UX Researcher, a Research Ops, a UX Designer, or a Product Manager, it'll be a powerful resource for you to improve the way your company does and consumes research.
