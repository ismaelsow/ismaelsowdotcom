Hi, I'm Ismaël. I write user research software, user research articles and I'm even writing a book about... user research. I used to be a software developer, analytics consultant, and A/B testing fanatic. I worked at Yahoo! and did consulting for several French enterprise companies like Carrefour and Orange.

I had a lot of dreams when I was young. That was a million years ago. The dinosaurs have disappeared since. Nowadays I mostly dream about UXR.
