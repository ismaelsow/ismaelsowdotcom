Hi, I'm Ismaël. I'm a software developer, analytics consultant, and A/B testing pro. I worked at Yahoo! and did some consulting for several French enterprise companies like Carrefour and Orange.

These days, I write software and articles on the Internet, mostly about user research. 

I'm reachable at ismael@searchness.com 👋
