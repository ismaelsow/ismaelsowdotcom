Hi, I'm Ismaël. I write user research software and articles about... user research. I used to be a software developer, an analytics consultant, and an A/B testing fanatic. I worked at Yahoo! and did consulting for several French enterprise companies like Carrefour and Orange.

I had a lot of dreams when I was young. The dinosaurs have disappeared since. 🦖 Nowadays I mostly dream about UXR.
